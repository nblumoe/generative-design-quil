# generative-design

These are the examples from the magnificent book "Generative Design" rewritten in Clojure using Quil.

The original examples are licensed under the Apache License. Get all information about the book and the original code at

The book is really great! Anything in this repository you might find intersting should be attributed to the authors of the book.

Any bug you find, is almost for sure my fault, though. Some details might be a bit different in my code, please don't expect this to show an
absolutely identical behaviour as the original implementations.

*Thanks to Hartmut Bohnacker, Benedikt Gro√ü, Julia Laub, Claudius Lazzeroni for producing the book and using the Apache License for the
 code.*
